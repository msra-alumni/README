Hello, This is the Microsoft Research Asia Student Alumni. 

## Reseaon for This Community
This community was established to strengthen the links between the internship partners of Microsoft Research Asia, and to facilitate the creation of some open source projects in the future.

In addition, join our community and you will have a Github badge from Microsoft Research Asia, which you can choose to display on your profile.

This organization is **purely an intern's own offline maintenance, and the released products and open source software are not related to Microsoft**.
